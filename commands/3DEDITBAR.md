# 3DEDITBAR (Command)

Reshapes splines and NURBS surfaces, including their tangency properties.

---

## Notes
- Provides grips for moving points and adjusting tangent magnitude and direction.  
- Works in the **U, V, and W** directions on NURBS surfaces.  

### Grips
- **Triangle grip:** Specifies the method for reshaping the selected object.  
- **Square grip:** Reshapes by moving the base point or changing tangent direction at the base point.  
  - Use axes to restrict movement to one axis.  
  - Use squares to restrict movement to one plane.  
- **Tangent arrow grip:** Adjusts the tangent magnitude at the base point.  
  - Lengthening flattens curvature.  
  - Arrow points in the direction of the surfaceâ€™s U, V, or W axis.

## Prompts

### Select a NURBS Surface or Curve to Edit
Specifies the object to be modified.  
- Valid: lines, arcs, circles, ellipses, elliptical arcs, polylines, helixes, splines, NURBS surfaces.  
- Non-surfaces may be converted to splines.  

### Select Point on Curve / NURBS Surface
Specifies a base point on the curve or surface. Changes are relative to this point.  

### Base Point
Specifies a new base point on the curve or NURBS surface.  

### Displacement
Specifies a new base point by projecting entered coordinates onto the curve or surface.  

### Undo
Cancels the previous change without exiting the command.  

### Exit
Cancels the current operation and returns to the previous prompt, or exits the command.
