# 3DCLIP (Command)

Opens the **Adjust Clipping Planes** window, where you can specify what portions of a 3D model to display.

---

## Notes
- The **Adjust Clipping Planes** window is displayed when you run this command.  
- Clipping planes are primarily a **viewing option**.  
- Use these commands for sectioning instead:  
  - [SECTIONPLANE](sectionplane.md) and [LIVESECTION](livesection.md) for live sections.  
  - [SECTION](section.md) for static sections.  
  - [VIEWSECTION](viewsection.md) for associative 2D drawings from AutoCAD and Autodesk Inventor models.
