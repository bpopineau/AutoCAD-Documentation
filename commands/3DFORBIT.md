# 3DFORBIT (Command)

Rotates the view in 3D space without constraining roll.

---

## Notes
- Activates a **3D Free Orbit** view in the current viewport.  
- The view displays an **arcball**, which defines the vantage point of the orbit.  
- Moving the cursor over the arcball changes the cursor icon to indicate the direction of rotation when dragging.  
- Unlike **3DORBIT**, this command does not constrain the orbit to a vertical or horizontal plane.  
- Selecting objects before starting limits the display to those objects only.  
- Right-click during the command to access additional shortcut menu options.  
  - Example: **Enable Orbit Auto Target** controls whether the orbit rotates the objects or the camera.  
- You cannot edit objects while this command is active.
