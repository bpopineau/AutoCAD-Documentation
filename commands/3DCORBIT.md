Rotates the view in 3D space with continuous motion.

---

## Notes
- You can view your entire drawing or select one or more objects before starting the command.  
- Selecting objects before starting limits the display to only those objects.  
- While active, right-click to display additional shortcut menu options.  
- **Performance:** Adaptive degradation is not implemented for continuous orbit. Large 3D models using rendered visual styles may display choppy motion.
