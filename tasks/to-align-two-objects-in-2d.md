# To Align Two Objects in 2D

---

## Steps
1. On the ribbon, click **Home > Modify > Align**.  
2. Select the objects you want to align.  
3. Specify a **source point** and then the corresponding **destination point**.  
4. (Optional) To rotate the object, specify a **second source point** followed by a **second destination point**.  
5. Press **Enter** to end the command.  

---

## Result
- The selected objects are moved from the source point to the destination point.  
- If second and third points are specified, the objects are rotated and tilted accordingly.
