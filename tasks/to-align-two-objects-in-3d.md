# To Align Two Objects in 3D

---

## Steps
1. On the ribbon, click **Home > Modify > 3D Align**.  
2. Select the objects you want to align.  
3. Specify one, two, or three **source points**, followed by the corresponding **destination points**.  
   - The **first point** is the base point.  
   - The **second point** (if specified) rotates the objects.  
   - The **third point** (if specified) further rotates and tilts the objects.  

---

## Result
- The selected objects are moved from the source point to the destination point.  
- Second and third points (if specified) rotate and tilt the objects in 3D space.
